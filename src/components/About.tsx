            I am a developer with 5 years of experience 👨‍💻, my favorite
            programming language is JavaScript 💻 but I also have experience in
            other languages such as Java ☕. I worked 2 years as an automation
            tester 🧪, so I understand the importance of high-quality code ✅. I
            also have experience working as a full-stack developer 🌐, where I
            contribute continuously to multiple projects, collaborating with
            team members from different countries 🌍 such as the USA 🇺🇸, England
            🇬🇧, India 🇮🇳, and China 🇨🇳.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my free time, I am always looking for personal growth 🌱. I also
            like doing exercise 🏋️‍♂️ since it is a good way to stay relaxed and
            balanced ✨.
